## About skyBREAK

![image of skyBREAK and real life game skyBREAK](http://i66.tinypic.com/2im81gn.jpg)

![Welcome to the Game II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/720250/Welcome_to_the_Game_II/) is an atmospheric horror / strategy / puzzle game that takes you into the world of the deep web, in search of the shadow web. 

The game puts you to the task of saving a girl, Amalea, and how to get there. You are tasked to seek out 8 hidden hashes to decrypt the shadow web browser. You do this by using a simulated computer operating system on a computer. This simulated operating system will come with tools to help you on your way. One of these tools is a wifi hacking tool called "![skyBREAK](https://welcometothegame.fandom.com/wiki/SkyBREAK)", based on the real life tool, ![Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/).

## How to Install

1. Download manually from the Github page.
<br> **or**
2. Type in your terminal:
`git clone https://www.github.com/lin8x/skybreak`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Run

Open your terminal and type:
`sudo python3 setup.py`

Once its finished, type and enter `skybreak` to run the tool.

**Troubleshooting**

If typing `skybreak` does not work, then either you did not run the `setup.py` file or your linux distro doesn't support the file setup it uses.

Most files go to `~/usr/share/skybreak` and the `skybreak.sh` goes to `~/usr/bin`.

An alternative way to run the tool is `sudo python3 ~/usr/share/skybreak/skybreak.py`.
